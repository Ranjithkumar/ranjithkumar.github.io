If you wanna display the list of records with different(alternate) classes for table rows, then you can use this helper(you no need to check odd-even records). Rails has so many awesome feature like this.

for ex: if you want to apply 'odd' and 'even' class for alternate record<!--more-->


    
    
     -season_hash.each do |k, v|
       %tr{:class => "#{cycle('odd', 'even')}"}
         %td= v["games"]
         %td= v["goals"]
         %td= v["assists"]
         %td= v["practices"]
